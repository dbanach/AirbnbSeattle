# Rent Prediction Model
#### (Project still in development)


#The Project.
 This project shows the creation of a rent prediction model  
 based on data from the famous [Kaggle Airbnb Seattle dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/airbnb/seattle).  
   
 The idea of this project is to create the best model possible
 and then deploy the model in AWS.

This file contains the code from the previous file but adjusted to
   a more standard production shape. 
   
###4. helper_functions.py  
This is a file with functions that were used to help in the
